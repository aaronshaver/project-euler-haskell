-- I got most of the fib function from https://wiki.haskell.org/The_Fibonacci_sequence

-- The a+b is an accumulator argument which passes state to subsequent
-- calls of the function so that you don't need to re-compute earlier
-- calls, drastically increasing performance.

-- I stripped out the bang patterns as they made no noticable difference
-- for this problem.
